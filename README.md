Using TF-IDF for movie recommendations 

We created a movie recommendation system in Python using TF-IDF. Essentially, TF-IDF measures how frequently and infrequently words occur across all documents. The product tf x idf outputs a product of how frequent a given word is in the document multipled by how unique a word is with respect to the entire corpus of documents. Words with high TF-IDF scores appear more frequently in the document and thus provide the most information of the document we are analyzing.
